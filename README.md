# Athloi Relived
A command-line, text-based adventure game reliving the Twelve Labors of Hercules

I am making this text-based game for my Mythology class at BYU, but my intent is to keep working on it for fun. It's a nice, small scale with plenty of room for artistic license. 

# Status
Alpha development. Currently, it only runs through the First Labor and hard stops.
