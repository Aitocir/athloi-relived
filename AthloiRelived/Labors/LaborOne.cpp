"Mustering all of your strength, you hang on as the Lion thrashes about and slowly suffocates. After several minutes, it goes limp as the breath of life ebbs from its carcass. Since nobody is present to see your lapse in heroic poise, you collapse against a nearby boulder and catch your breath.\n\n"\

"... and buries its entire length into the roof of the Lion's mouth, a tell-tale bump in the Lion's impervious fur showing the arrow trying to pierce straight through its head. The Lion falls to the ground, skidding across the dirt, coming to a stop at your feet. Placing on efoot on its head, you take advantage of the moment to strike a glorious pose, regretting the lack of a nearby artist to capture the moment.\n\n"\

You try desperately to pretend that she didn't catch you trying in frustration to gnaw a hole in the Lion's hide so you could remove it. Athena, with a smirk on her face, suggests you use the Lion's own claws to cut the hide away from the carcass. You thank her and wait for her to leave before removing the hide and making your way back to King Eurystheus.\n\n"\
"Hundreds of cheers erupt as the twonsfolk of Cleonae spot you coming back on the road through their town with the Lion's hide across your back. You catch sight of the boy you ran into on your way in, and see tears of gratitude in his eyes. With a short layover for much-deserved rest, you return to King Eurystheus.\n\n"\
"You approach your cousin the King who is standing with his back toward you. His aides see the hide you're carrying and immediately stand more erect, and begin whispering amonst themselves.\n\n"\
"[King Eurystheus] \"And who bears the body of beloved cousin?\" he enquired, back still turned, obviously misreading the situation. \"I can't say I'm-- hounds of Hades!!!\" he almost squeaked as he finally turned and noticed the fur across your back.\n\n"\
"[Heracles] \"Do you care for it? I thought the color complimented my features nicely,\" you reply, as the women and a few men giggle to themselves. You continue to speak as the King stands speechless. \"I have completed the first of your Ten Labors, cousin. What shall be my second?\"\n\n"\
"[King Eurystheus] \"Out, sir, out! I shall send word to you for your second task.\"\n\n"\
"As you stand awkwardly wondering what the disconnect was, the King screamed once more, this time with a break in his voice making his order sound more like a plea. Out of pity as much as respect, you descend from the palace and to the gate of the city, where you are soon joined by a herald of the King.\n\n"\
